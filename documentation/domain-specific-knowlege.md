Understanding Myeloid Leukemias: Myeloid leukemias are cancers of the myeloid lineage of blood cells, primarily affecting adults. The most common type in adults is Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), which accounts for about 80% of adult leukemias and has a median age at diagnosis of around 68 years. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is another key subtype, driven by the BCR-ABL fusion gene, but AML is more heterogeneous and aggressive, with 5-year survival rates around 30% overall, dropping to 10-15% in older patients. Recognizing subtypes (e.g., de novo AML vs. secondary AML arising from myelodysplastic syndromes) is crucial, as they influence prognosis and treatment.
Prognostic Risk Stratification Systems: The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2022 guidelines provide a standardized risk classification for AML based on genetic abnormalities. Patients are categorized into favorable, intermediate, or adverse risk groups. Favorable includes mutations like NPM1 without FLT3-ITD or t(8;21); adverse includes TP53 mutations, complex karyotypes (â‰¥3 abnormalities), or inv(3); intermediate covers the rest. Integrating ELN categories as features can boost model accuracy, as they directly correlate with overall survival (OS): favorable ~60-70% 5-year OS, adverse ~10-20%.
Key Clinical Prognostic Factors: Bone marrow blast percentage (BM_BLAST) >20% defines AML per WHO criteria, with higher blasts (>50%) often indicating worse prognosis. White blood cell count (WBC) >100 x 10^9/L (hyperleukocytosis) is associated with early mortality due to leukostasis. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 x 10^9/L increases infection risk, hemoglobin (HB) <10 g/dL signals anemia severity, and platelet count (PLT) <20 x 10^9/L raises bleeding risk. Age is a major confounder (not directly in the dataset but inferable via proxies), as OS drops sharply after 60 years due to comorbidities and treatment intolerance.
Cytogenetic Abnormalities: Cytogenetics follow ISCN nomenclature (e.g., "46,XX,t(8;21)(q22;q22)" for a translocation). Core-binding factor leukemias like t(8;21) or inv(16) are favorable, while monosomy 5/7, del(5q), or complex karyotypes are adverse, linked to therapy resistance and relapse. Parsing ISCN strings via regex or NLP (e.g., extracting abnormality counts or specific translocations) can create binary/dummy features for models, as adverse cytogenetics reduce 5-year OS to <20%.
Common Somatic Mutations and Their Impact: AML harbors an average of 13 somatic mutations per patient, but driver mutations in ~10-15 key genes drive prognosis. FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) occurs in 25-30% of cases, confers poor prognosis (high relapse risk), especially with high allelic ratio (>0.5). NPM1 mutations (30% prevalence) are favorable if isolated, improving OS by 20-30%. TP53 mutations (8-10%) are strongly adverse, associated with chemoresistance and <10% long-term survival. IDH1/2 (15-20%) can be targeted with inhibitors like ivosidenib, with variable prognosis. DNMT3A (20-25%) often indicates persistent clonal hematopoiesis post-treatment. ASXL1, RUNX1, and SRSF2 are adverse in intermediate-risk groups. Aggregating mutations by gene, effect (e.g., loss-of-function vs. gain-of-function), or co-occurrence (e.g., NPM1 + DNMT3A + FLT3 triad) is essential for feature engineering.
Variant Allele Frequency (VAF): VAF represents the fraction of mutant alleles in tumor cells, typically >20% for clonal mutations. High VAF in adverse genes like TP53 (>40%) correlates with worse OS, indicating dominance of the mutant clone. Low VAF might suggest subclonal mutations with less immediate impact but potential for evolution under treatment. Features like mean VAF per gene or VAF-weighted mutation counts can capture tumor burden and heterogeneity.
Mutation Effects and Protein Changes: Mutations are classified as missense (amino acid substitution, e.g., R132H in IDH1), nonsense (premature stop), frameshift (insertion/deletion shifting reading frame), or splice-site. Loss-of-function effects (e.g., in tumor suppressors like TP53) are more deleterious than others. Grouping by effect type or using tools like SIFT/PolyPhen scores (if computable) can refine features, as certain changes (e.g., hotspot mutations) are more oncogenic.
Multi-Center Data Considerations: Data from 24 centers may introduce batch effects due to varying diagnostic standards, sequencing platforms, or follow-up protocols. Center-specific variables (e.g., CENTER column) should be encoded or used in stratified modeling to mitigate bias. Geographic/temporal variations in treatment (e.g., access to targeted therapies) could affect OS.
Survival Analysis Fundamentals: Overall survival (OS) is time-to-event data with right-censoring (OS_STATUS=0 means alive at last follow-up, observed time is censoring time). Ignoring censoring biases models toward shorter survivors. Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) assumes constant hazard ratios over time; violations (e.g., time-dependent effects of mutations) require extensions like time-varying covariates or Aalen's model. Alternatives like Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models or machine learning (e.g., Random Survival Forests, Gradient Boosted Survival) handle non-proportional hazards better. Deep learning survival models (e.g., DeepSurv) can integrate high-dimensional molecular data.
Handling Molecular Data: Since molecular data is long-format (one row per mutation), pivot to wide-format: binary indicators for gene mutations (e.g., FLT3_mutated=1/0), count of mutations per pathway (e.g., epigenetic regulators: DNMT3A, TET2, IDH), or mutational burden (total mutations). Co-mutation patterns (e.g., mutual exclusivity of NPM1 and RUNX1) inform interaction terms. Pathways like signaling (FLT3, KIT), transcription (RUNX1, CEBPA), or epigenetics cluster mutations for dimensionality reduction.
IPCW-C-Index Specifics: This metric weights comparable pairs by inverse probability of censoring, estimated via Kaplan-Meier on censoring distribution. Models should optimize for ranking, not absolute times (e.g., use negative log partial likelihood in Cox). Clipping at 7 years means focus on mid-term predictions; long-term survivors may be underrepresented.
Feature Engineering Ideas: Derive age proxies if possible (though not explicit), normalize lab values (e.g., log-transform WBC due to skewness), create composite scores (e.g., IPSS-R for MDS overlap if applicable), or use embeddings for cytogenetics text. Incorporate treatment implications: e.g., FLT3 mutations qualify for midostaurin, potentially improving OS in models accounting for era effects.
Potential Biases and Ethics: Real-world data may have selection bias (e.g., fitter patients get sequenced). Ensure models don't amplify disparities (e.g., by center socioeconomic status). Validate for subgroups (e.g., age, sex inferred from karyotype like XX/XY).
Advanced Modeling: Ensemble survival models (e.g., stacking Cox with XGBoost survival). Use SHAP values for interpretability, as clinical adoption requires explainable predictions. Cross-validation must be time-aware to prevent leakage (e.g., no future data in training).
